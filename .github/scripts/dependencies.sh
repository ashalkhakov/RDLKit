# Build the GNUstep stack RDLKit needs, from source, into $INSTALL_PATH.
#
# This follows the recipe from the user's gnustep-build repository, which is
# the known-good one: it is what their Forgejo instance builds the whole
# GNUstep stack with. The four things that matter and that a Foundation-only
# CI script would leave out:
#
#   --with-layout=gnustep    the cohesive System/Local hierarchy, rather than
#                            the flattened bin/lib/share one. Everything that
#                            packages a GNUstep tree -- our AppImage scripts
#                            included -- assumes this shape.
#   --enable-objc-arc        RDLKit is ARC throughout.
#   CPPFLAGS/LDFLAGS         point the compiler at the prefix so configure
#                            actually detects the libobjc2 built a step
#                            earlier, instead of falling back silently.
#   standalone.conf          makes libs-base read its config from the prefix,
#                            so the tree can be moved -- which is precisely
#                            what mounting an AppImage does.
#
# RDLKit needs more of the stack than a Foundation-only project would: RDLKit
# draws through AppKit, so libs-gui and a graphics backend are required, and
# both test bundles are XCTest, so tools-xctest is too. The theme and
# libs-corebase from that recipe are not built here; nothing in RDLKit uses
# them.
#
# Expects: CC, CXX, LIBRARY_COMBO, RUNTIME_VERSION, DEPS_PATH, INSTALL_PATH.
