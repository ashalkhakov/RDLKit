# A GNUstep box to reproduce the Linux build locally, so a portability bug can

# Build it once -- this compiles libobjc2, libdispatch, gnustep-make, base, gui,
# back and tools-xctest from source, so it takes the better part of an hour:
#
#   docker build -f .tools/gnustep.Dockerfile -t rdlkit-gnustep .
#
# After that the image is cached and running the suites is quick:
#
#   .tools/gnustep.sh make -C PicaKitTests run-tests
#   .tools/gnustep.sh make -C PicaDesignerTests run-tests
#
# The stack is the same one the workflow builds, from the same script, so what
# fails here fails there.

# "Hash Sum mismatch" from a caching proxy is the usual way this build dies, so

# in two so a failure does not re-download the lot.

# Not built successfully on this machine: its network path corrupts plain HTTP
# from ports.ubuntu.com -- a 178 kB package arriving as 42 MB, reported as
# "File has unexpected size" -- and drops HTTPS to the same host entirely, so
# apt sees "Ign:" for every InRelease and ends up with no package lists. On a
# network that does neither, this builds as written. If yours does, point apt
# at a mirror you trust by editing /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources here.
