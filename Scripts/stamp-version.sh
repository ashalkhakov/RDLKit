# Write a version into everything the About panel reads, so a packaged build
# says which build it is.
#
#   ./Scripts/stamp-version.sh 1.2.3
#
# No number in the repository is maintained by hand: the version comes from the
# tag, or from the run number and the commit for an unreleased build -- the
# same value the AppImage and the macOS archives are named after. What is in
# the tree is 0.0.0-dev, which is what a build from a working copy is.
#
# Two files, four keys and two build settings:
#   * RDLDesigner-Info.plist is the bundle's plist on BOTH platforms.
#     gnustep-make looks for <App>-Info.plist and merges it into the
#     Info-gnustep.plist it generates, so ApplicationRelease and FullVersionID
#     -- which GSInfoPanel shows -- live here beside CFBundleShortVersionString
#     and CFBundleVersion.
#   * project.pbxproj MARKETING_VERSION / CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION -- Xcode
#     builds with GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE, so on macOS these are what actually
#     land in the built bundle, whatever the plist file says.
#
# Two forms of the version go in, because Apple parses some of these keys and
# GNUstep does not:
#
#   display -- the version as given, less any leading "v". The GNUstep About
#     panel shows this, and it can say anything: "0.0.0-229-18df32a" identifies
#     a build in a way a release number cannot.
#   numeric -- the leading dotted number of that, and nothing else. Xcode
#     compiles CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION into a generated <Target>_vers.c as a
#     double, so the tag v0.1.0 arrived there as (double)v0.1.0 and the
#     framework failed to build with "use of undeclared identifier 'v0'".
#     CFBundleShortVersionString and CFBundleVersion are Apple's as well, and
#     are documented as period-separated integers.
